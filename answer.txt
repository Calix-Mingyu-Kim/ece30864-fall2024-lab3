Pros and Cons of Agile: 
    Pros:
        1. More resilient to change (scope of the project, implementation)
        2. Breaks down a project to several stages, employ continuous integration
    Cons:
        1. Long term projects suffer from incremental delivery (not all projects are Agile-able!)
        2. Inadequate documentation (e.g. dev team moving to different projects every sprints)
